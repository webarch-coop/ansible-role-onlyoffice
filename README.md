# ONLYOFFICE Document Server Asnible Role

This Ansible role is based on the instructions for [Installing Document Server
for Linux on Debian, Ubuntu and
derivatives](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/linux/document/linux-installation.aspx).

The ONLYOFFICE code is [available on GitHub under the
AGPL](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer).

There is a [development repo available
here](https://git.coop/webarch/nextcloud-server) that builds a ONLYOFFICE
server using this role.
